# Comparative Analysis of YOLOv8 and DETR on TUM RGB-D Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comparative study of two state-of-the-art object detection models — **YOLOv8** and **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** — evaluated on the **TUM RGB-D indoor dataset**.

The objective is to analyze their performance with respect to:
- Detection speed
- Accuracy and robustness
- Occlusion handling
- Suitability for real-time and semantic SLAM-based applications

This work is particularly motivated by applications in **robotics, indoor scene understanding, and semantic SLAM**.
